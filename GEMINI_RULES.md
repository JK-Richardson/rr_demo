## Code Style and Quality

-   **Type Annotations:** All new Python code (function signatures, variable declarations where appropriate) must include type annotations.

## Code Quality Checks

-   **Linting (Ruff):** After making any code changes, the `ruff` linter must be run on the modified files to ensure adherence to code style and identify potential issues. All reported errors and warnings must be addressed before considering the task complete.
